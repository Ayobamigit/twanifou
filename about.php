								<h3>Message From Our Chairperson</h3>
									
								
							</div>

				
							<p >
							The establishment of Twani Foundation was borne out of the desire to create a vehicle for a sustainable peace process in Nigeria. The absence of peace has robbed us of development and the continuous act of violence has placed us below expectation thereby creating tension and unwanted desires among citizens seeking equality and justice.<br>Our intention is to partner with institutions of state, private sector and the general public toward galvanising support in peace promotion. Our activities are geared toward creating mutual platform for peace awareness, mediation and reconciliation to promote unity and togetherness.<br>The wounds from violence engagements in time past are a priority that we all must put to the front burner. My team and I are working round the clock to initiative peace reconciliation programs among warring communities and government for settlement. We kindly solicit support from institutions of government, private sector, International communities and individuals to support our cause. Peace is a possibility and together we can achieve a better place for a better world.

							</p>
